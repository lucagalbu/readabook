    """Gets the default credentials for the current environment.

    `Application Default Credentials`_ provides an easy way to obtain
    credentials to call Google APIs for server-to-server or local applications.
    This function acquires credentials from the environment in the following
    order:

    1. If the environment variable ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` is set
       to the path of a valid service account JSON private key file, then it is
       loaded and returned. The project ID returned is the project ID defined
       in the service account file if available (some older files do not
       contain project ID information).

       If the environment variable is set to the path of a valid external
       account JSON configuration file (workload identity federation), then the
       configuration file is used to determine and retrieve the external
       credentials from the current environment (AWS, Azure, etc).
       These will then be exchanged for Google access tokens via the Google STS
       endpoint.
       The project ID returned in this case is the one corresponding to the
       underlying workload identity pool resource if determinable.
    2. If the `Google Cloud SDK`_ is installed and has application default
       credentials set they are loaded and returned.

       To enable application default credentials with the Cloud SDK run::

            gcloud auth application-default login

       If the Cloud SDK has an active project, the project ID is returned. The
       active project can be set using::

            gcloud config set project

    3. If the application is running in the `App Engine standard environment`_
       (first generation) then the credentials and project ID from the
       `App Identity Service`_ are used.
    4. If the application is running in `Compute Engine`_ or `Cloud Run`_ or
       the `App Engine flexible environment`_ or the `App Engine standard
       environment`_ (second generation) then the credentials and project ID
       are obtained from the `Metadata Service`_.
    5. If no credentials are found,
       :class:`~google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError` will be raised.

            ID for a workload identity pool resource (external account
            credentials). If not specified, then it will either use the standard

        quota_project_id (Optional[str]): The project ID used for
